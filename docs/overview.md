## Introduction

`kotaemon` library focuses on the AI building blocks to implement the Kotaemon. It can be used in both client project and in product development. It consists of base interfaces, core components and a list of utilities:

- Base interfaces: `kotaemon` defines the base interface of a component in a pipeline. A pipeline is also a component. By clearly define this interface, a pipeline of steps can be easily constructed and orchestrated.
- Core components: `kotaemon` implements (or wraps 3rd-party libraries like Langchain, llama-index,... when possible) commonly used components in kotaemon use cases. Some of these components are: LLM, vector store, document store, retriever... For a detailed list and description of these components, please refer to the [Pipeline Components](Pipeline-Components) and [Data & Data Structure Components](Data-&-Data-Structure-Components) sections.
- List of utilities: `lib-knowledge` provides utilities and tools that are usually needed in client project. For example, it provides a prompt engineering UI for AI developers in a project to quickly create a prompt engineering tool for DMs and QALs. It also provides a command to quickly spin up a project code base. For a full list and description of these utilities, please refer to the [Utilities](Utilities) section.

## Expected benefit

Before `kotaemon`:

- Starting everything from scratch.
- Knowledge and expertise is fragmented.
- Nothing to reuse.
- No way to collaborate between tech and non-tech experts.

`kotaemon` expects to completely revolutionize the way we are building LLM-related projects. It helps the company side-steps those issues by:

- Standardize the interface to (1) make building LLM pipeline clearer (2) more reasonable to integrate pipelines between different projects.
- Centralize LLM-related technical components into 1 place. Avoid fragmented technology development. Easy to find the LLM-related technology inside the company.
- Centralize bug fixes and improvements in 1 place.
- Reduce boilerplate code during project development.
- Lightning fast prototyping.

## Install

The kotaemon can be installed from source with:

```
pip install kotaemon@git+ssh://git@github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon.git
```

or from Cinnamon's internal python package index:

```
pip install kotaemon --extra-index-url https://ian_devpi.promptui.dm.cinnamon.is/root/packages
```

## Example use cases

- Start a project from scratch: `kh start-project`
- Run prompt engineering UI tool: `kh promptui export`, then `kh promptui run`.
